# Contributing to JRuby
  
JRuby depends on community contributions to survive. Here's how you can get involved:

**Get the Source** - The JRuby source is co-located in our Kenai.com repository and a GitHub mirror.

- **Kenai.com**: [**Browse**](http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/sources/main/show) &nbsp;|&nbsp;[**Checkout**](git://kenai.com/jruby~main)
- **GitHub**: [**Browse**](http://github.com/jruby/jruby) &nbsp;|&nbsp;[**Checkout**](git://github.com/jruby/jruby.git)

**Build JRuby** - Once you've checked out the source, you just need to run &quot;ant&quot;&nbsp;or &quot;ant jar&quot;&nbsp;to build and &quot;ant test&quot;&nbsp;to run our test suite. We depend on <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> 1.7.0 or higher.

**Report or Fix Bugs** - Our bug tracker uses Atlassian JIRA. You are encouraged to report bugs, no matter how small. Performance problems are considered bugs, so please report those too. You are also encouraged to help triage or fix open bugs and we're standing by to assist you.

- **Bug Tracker**: [**Browse**]({{ site.urls.jira }})

**Edit the Wiki** - We also depend on community contributions and edits to keep the wiki informative and relevant. If you have a useful FAQ or walkthrough or article, please add it to the wiki. And we welcome anyone who wants to help reorganize or edit existing content.
