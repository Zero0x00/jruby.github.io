# JRuby on Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

Most of the JRuby team and much of the community hangs out on IRC, and we welcome everyone to join us!

If you have an IRC client, just connect to <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#jruby">chat.freenode.net and join the #jruby channel</a>.

If you don't have a client, you can [click here to use Kiwi IRC](http://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/#jruby).

You can also provide a nickname below and chat with us immediately!
