# JRuby Nightly Builds

Each night, we publish builds of our stable and development branches. At times, these may be the same version.

**JRuby dist**: The installable distribution of JRuby is in the `jruby-bin` files. Unpack it, run `bin/jruby` and you're all set.

**Complete jar**: The "complete" jar, containing all standad libraries and preinstalled gems, is in the `jruby-complete...jar` file.

**jruby-jars gem**: For gem dependencies on JRuby, install the `jruby-jars` gem.

**Sources**: JRuby sources for this build are in `jruby-src` files.
