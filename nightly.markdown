# JRuby Nightly Builds

We publish snapshots of our development branches after every successful CI run.

[**JRuby dist**](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jruby/jruby-dist/): The installable distribution of JRuby is in the `jruby-bin` files. Unpack it, run `bin/jruby` and you're all set.

[**Complete jar**](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jruby/jruby-complete/): The "complete" jar, containing all standad libraries and preinstalled gems, is in the `jruby-complete...jar` file.

[**Other artifacts**](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jruby/): The full complement of Maven artifacts are available as snapshots.
