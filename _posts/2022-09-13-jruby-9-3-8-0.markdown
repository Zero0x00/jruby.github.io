title: JRuby 9.3.8.0 Released
---

The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.3.8.0

* Homepage: [https://www.jruby.org/](https://www.jruby.org/)
* Download: [https://www.jruby.org/download](https://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 9.3.x is compatible with Ruby 2.6.x and stays in sync with C Ruby. As always there is a mix of miscellaneous fixes so be sure to read the issue list below.

Thanks to our contributors this cycle for helping to improve stability and compatibility of JRuby 9.3: [@ahorek], [@ccutrer], [@evaniainbrooks], [@naveensrinivasan]

Ruby Compatibility
------------------

* Altering the visibility of an included module method no longer changes what super method gets called. ([#7240], [#7343], [#7344], [#7356])
* Thread termination at shutdown is more robust and visits all non-main threads. ([#7351])

Standard Library
----------------

* csv has been updated to 3.2.5 to pick up a fix that eliminates fiber use for simple parse_line calls. ([#7346], [#7348])
* psych has been updated to 3.3.3 to address CVE-2022-25857, an element-nesting DoS. ([#7342])

Experimental Features
---------------------

* Fibers can now be configured to use OpenJDK Project Loom's virtual threads, which are lightweight and do not consume a native platform thread. Virtual threads make it possible for JRuby applications to create thousands of concurrently-executing fibers. Enable this feature on Java 19 using the JVM flag `--enable-preview`. ([#7328])
