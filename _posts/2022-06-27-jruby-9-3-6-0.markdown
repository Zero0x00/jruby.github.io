Thanks to our contributors this cycle for helping to improve stability and compatibility of JRuby 9.3: [@ahorek], [@keimar], [@k77ch7]

Ruby Compatibility
------------------

* Fixed a leak in the frozen string cache and now ensure frozen strings are reused correctly without reencoding. ([#7166], [#7229], [#7242])

Java Integration
----------------

* The internal cache for nested jar file contents has been optimized and a new option added for cache expiration. ([#7225], [#7232], [#7259])
