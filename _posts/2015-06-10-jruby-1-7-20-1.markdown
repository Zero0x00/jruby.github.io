JRuby 1.7.20.1 is our twenty-fourth update release since JRuby 1.7.0.  The primary goal of 1.7 point releases is to fill out any missing compatibility issues with Ruby 1.9.3.

This security release only updated Rubygems to version 2.4.8.  Rubygems 2.4.8
addresses CVE-2015-1855 to resolve some problems with wildcard matching
of hostnames.  See [ruby-lang.org's](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/04/13/ruby-openssl-hostname-matching-vulnerability/) description for more info.  All
users are recommended to upgrade.
