title: JRuby 9.2.14.0 Released
---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.2.14.0

- Homepage: [http://www.jruby.org/](http://www.jruby.org/)
- Download: [http://www.jruby.org/download](http://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 9.2.x is compatible with Ruby 2.5.x and stays in sync with C Ruby.  As always there is a mix of miscellaneous fixes so be sure to read the issue list below.  All users are encouraged to upgrade.

As we are still actively working on 9.3.0.0 we decided to put out another 9.2.x release to fix some of the more recently reported issues.

Security
--------

* The WEBrick HTTP server has been updated to 1.6.1 to address CVE-2020-25613. ([#6462](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6462), [#6463](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6463))

Standard Library
----------------

* did_you_mean was updated to 1.2.1 to remove some Creative Commons licensed content. ([#6471](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6471), [#6473](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6473))
* jruby-openssl was updated to 0.10.5 to eliminate some Java module warnings and improve compatibility. ([#6423](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6423))

Concurrency
-----------

* A race in storing the lock a thread has just acquired was fixed, preventing that lock from being left locked if the thread dies prematurely. ([#6326](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6326), [#6405](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6405), [#6407](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6407))

Performance
-----------

* Call sites bound using invokedynamic were not inlining due to a quirk of classloading on OpenJDK. This has been fixed so such calls inline properly. ([#6280](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6280))

Native Integration
------------------

* The Java Native Runtime used to integrate with native system code has been updated to latest versions to improve compatibility. ([#6482](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6482))
