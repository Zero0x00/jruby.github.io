---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.2.11.1

- Homepage: [http://www.jruby.org/](http://www.jruby.org/)
- Download: [http://www.jruby.org/download](http://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 9.2.x is compatible with Ruby 2.5.x and stays in sync with C Ruby.  As always there is a mix of miscellaneous fixes so be sure to read the issue list below.  All users are encouraged to upgrade.

As we are actively working on 9.3.0.0 we decided to put out a mini release which fixes a single issue.

* sprintf substring string formatting with precision may expose characters ([#6137](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6137))

If you format a string using a precision specifier (e.g. %.1s) AND you pass in a substring of a larger string, you may see some of the larger string's characters in the formatted result.  This is due to a bug in the handling of internal String data that causes the result to contain more characters than requested.

```ruby
long_string = "aabbccddhelloddccbbaa"
start_index = 8
sub_str_length = 5
precision = 3
sub_string = long_string[start_index, sub_str_length]
puts sprintf("%.#{precision}s", sub_string)
# => helloddccbb
```

This bug could potentially expose sensitive content from the original String. It is unlikely to affect most users, but you are still encouraged to upgrade.
