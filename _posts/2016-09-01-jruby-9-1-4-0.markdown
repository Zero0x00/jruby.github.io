JRuby 9000 is the newest major version of JRuby, representing years of effort and large-scale reboots of several JRuby subsystems.  It is expected to be compatible with Ruby 2.x and stay in sync with C Ruby.  JRuby 9.1.4.0 is our latest release...

Major features of JRuby 9000:

- Ruby 2.x compatibility
- A new optimizing runtime based on a traditional compiler design
- New POSIX-friendly IO and Process
- Fully ported encoding/transcoding logic from MRI

If you do find issues then report them on using our issue tracker at [http://bugs.jruby.org](http://bugs.jruby.org). We also encourage users to join our IRC channel (#jruby on Freenode) and mailing lists. You may also follow [@jruby](https://twitter.com/jruby) on Twitter for updates.

This release addresses a serious regression in 9.1.3.0 where some 2-element arrays would return the wrong value.  All users are strongly recommended to upgrade to 9.1.4.0.
