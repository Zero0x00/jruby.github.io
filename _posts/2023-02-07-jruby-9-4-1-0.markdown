The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.4.0.0.

* Homepage: [https://www.jruby.org/](https://www.jruby.org/)
* Download: [https://www.jruby.org/download](https://www.jruby.org/download)

Thank you to our contributors this release, you help keep JRuby moving forward! [@ahorek], [@cboos], [@evaniainbrooks], [@jcharaoui], [@k77ch7], [@knovok], [@Panxuefeng-loongson], [@ydah]

Thanks also to the community of JRuby users for trying out JRuby 9.4.0.0 and filing issues! We're proud to include so many fixes in this update release and we couldn't have done it without your bug reports.

Ruby Compatibility
------------------

* Several fixes to keyword arguments are included in this release. [#7434], [#7494], [#7497], [#7502], [#7513], [#7537], [#7552], [#7561], [#7572], [#7573], [#7574], [#7583], [#7592], [#7593]
* Random has been fixed to work properly with SecureRandom, which was generating all zeros. [#7586], [#7597], [#7607], [#7617]

Standard Library
----------------

* The Psych YAML library is updated to 5.1.0. This version switches the JRuby extension to SnakeYAML Engine, avoiding CVEs against the original SnakeYAML and updating YAML compatibility to specification version 1.2. [#6365], [#7570], [#7626]

Platform Support
----------------

* Final changes to support the LoongArch64 architecture have been merged in. [#7518]

Performance
-----------

* Overall JIT bytecode size has been improved, allowing more methods to compile to JVM bytecode. The maximum IR size eligible for JIT has been increased from 1000 instructions to 3000 instructions. [#7589]
