---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.2.11.0

- Homepage: [http://www.jruby.org/](http://www.jruby.org/)
- Download: [http://www.jruby.org/download](http://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 9.2.x is compatible with Ruby 2.5.x and stays in sync with C Ruby.  As always there is a mix of miscellaneous fixes so be sure to read the issue list below.  All users are encouraged to upgrade.

Java Integration
----------------

* Gems and gem paths packaged inside jar files will properly load now. This 9.2.10.0 regression was caused by a change in RubyGems 3 that exposed a bug in JRuby. ([#6060](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6060), [#6082](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6082), [#6083](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6083), [#6084](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6084))

Performance Improvements
------------------------

* Fixed a major performance and memory bottleneck in backtrace generation, used by `Kernel#caller` and friends. This was a regression in 9.2.10.0. ([#6089](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6089))
