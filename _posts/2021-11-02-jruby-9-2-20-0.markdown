---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.2.20.0

- Homepage: [http://www.jruby.org/](http://www.jruby.org/)
- Download: [http://www.jruby.org/download](http://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 9.2.x is compatible with Ruby 2.5.x and stays in sync with C Ruby.  As always there is a mix of miscellaneous fixes so be sure to read the issue list below.  All users are encouraged to upgrade.

Compatiblity
------------

* Argument-count errors will now produce a more accurate backtrace. ([#6335](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6335), [#6768](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6768), [#6771](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6771), [#6846](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6846), [#6928](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6928))

Standard Library
----------------

* jruby-openssl has been updated to 0.11.0, which includes fixes for expired and replaced certificate verification. ([#6871](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6872), [#6909](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6909))

Native Integration
------------------

* The built-in FFI library has been updated to match the FFI gem, and can now be upgraded independently of JRuby. ([#6732](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6732), [#6747](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6747))
* FFI-based core methods on Windows and Solaris have been modified to delay activating FFI until after RubyGems has loaded any upgrades. ([#6751](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6751), [#6760](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6760), [#6762](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6762))

Java Integration
----------------

* Nested jar files (jars packaged within another application jar) should load more quickly with caching improvements. ([#6730](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6730), [#6734](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6734), [#6740](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6740))
