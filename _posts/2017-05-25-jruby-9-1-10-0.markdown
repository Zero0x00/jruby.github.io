The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.1.10.0

JRuby 9000 is the newest major version of JRuby, representing years of effort and large-scale reboots of several JRuby subsystems.  It is expected to be compatible with Ruby 2.x and stay in sync with C Ruby.  JRuby 9.1.10.0 is our latest release...

Major features of JRuby 9000:

- Ruby 2.x compatibility
- A new optimizing runtime based on a traditional compiler design
- New POSIX-friendly IO and Process
- Fully ported encoding/transcoding logic from MRI

If you do find issues then report them on using our issue tracker at [http://bugs.jruby.org](http://bugs.jruby.org). We also encourage users to join our IRC channel (#jruby on Freenode) and mailing lists. You may also follow [@jruby](https://twitter.com/jruby) on Twitter for updates.

This release just fixes two regressions:

- ```arr.with_index {|v| }``` was passing ```[element, index]``` to v instead of just ```element```.
- ```type.become_java!``` was raising when it could not become a java reified type but JRubyFX depends on this completing without error.
