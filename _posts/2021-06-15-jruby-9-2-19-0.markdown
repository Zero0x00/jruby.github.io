title: JRuby 9.2.18.0 Released
---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.2.18.0

- Homepage: [http://www.jruby.org/](http://www.jruby.org/)
- Download: [http://www.jruby.org/download](http://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 9.2.x is compatible with Ruby 2.5.x and stays in sync with C Ruby.  As always there is a mix of miscellaneous fixes so be sure to read the issue list below.  All users are encouraged to upgrade.

As we are still actively working on 9.3.0.0 we decided to put out another 9.2.x release to fix some of the more recently reported issues.

Thanks to contributor @ahorek for a couple quick-fix PRs this release!

Native Integration
------------------

* Work around a bug in our backend FFI library, jnr-ffi, that broke calls to `getsockopt` or `setsockopt` in `--dev` mode. ([#6714](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6714), [#6723](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6723))

Windows Support
---------------

* Honor the TZ environment variable when applying a timezone to file modification/access/create times. ([#6659](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6659), [#6720](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6720))
