The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.3.15.0

* Homepage: [https://www.jruby.org/](https://www.jruby.org/)
* Download: [https://www.jruby.org/download](https://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 9.3.x is compatible with Ruby 2.6.x and stays in sync with C Ruby. As always there is a mix of miscellaneous fixes so be sure to read the issue list below.

This release only fixes a single problem. "AOT" compiled ruby (using jrubyc) had an uncommon race condition which led to strange endless looping behavior.
