title: JRuby 9.2.13.0 Released
---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.2.13.0

- Homepage: [http://www.jruby.org/](http://www.jruby.org/)
- Download: [http://www.jruby.org/download](http://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 9.2.x is compatible with Ruby 2.5.x and stays in sync with C Ruby.  As always there is a mix of miscellaneous fixes so be sure to read the issue list below.  All users are encouraged to upgrade.

As we are still actively working on 9.3.0.0 we decided to put out another 9.2.x release to fix some of the more recently reported issues.

Security
--------

* An alias-expansion bug reported in [CVE-2017-18640](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18640) has been patched
  by upgrading the Psych YAML library to use a newer version of SnakeYAML. ([#6320](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6320),
  [#6332](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6332), [ruby/psych#457](https://github.com/ruby/psych/pull/457))

Concurrency
-----------

* Internal structures used to optimize Ruby code have been made more thread-safe. Previously, these optimizations could
  be seen across threads in a partially-complete state, leading to errors in JRuby's core runtime.
  ([#6319](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6319), [#6323](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6323),
  [#6337](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6337))

Ruby Compatibility
------------------

* IO.copy_stream has been fixed to ensure all read bytes are written. Previously, partial writes would leave some
  read bytes in limbo, leading to hangs in net/http among other libraries.
  ([#6078](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6078), [#6348](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6348))
* Fixed a regression from 9.2.12.0 in how we translate JDK socket errors to Ruby's Errno on Windows.
  ([#6322](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6322), [#6328](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6328))
  
FFI
---

* FFI has been patched to not automatically release memory pointers when autorelease is disabled. This caused crashes
  in the sassc native library and possibly others. ([#6310](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6310),
  [#6331](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6331))
