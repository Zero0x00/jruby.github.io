---

The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.4.7.0.

* Homepage: [https://www.jruby.org/](https://www.jruby.org/)
* Download: [https://www.jruby.org/download](https://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 9.4.x targets Ruby 3.1 compatibility.

Thank you to our contributors this release, you help keep JRuby moving forward! [@kares], [@ryannevell], [@jsvd]

Ruby Compatibility
------------------

* Many edge cases in language compatibility have been fixed. [#7440], [#8128], [#8192], [#8193], [#8195], [#8197], [#8198]

Standard Library
----------------

* jruby-openssl is updated to 0.14.5
* rdoc is updated to 6.4.1.1
* Warnings due to method aliasing in the ostruct library have been mitigated. [#8200], [#8206]

JVM Integration
---------------

* Ruby classes that are "reified" into a Java class and later redefined can be "re-reified" to a new Java class with an incrementing version number. [#8141], [#8185]
* Java objects from other classloaders can pollute the `Java::` namespace. This behavior can be disabled now, and will be disabled by default in JRuby 10. [#8156], [#8208]
