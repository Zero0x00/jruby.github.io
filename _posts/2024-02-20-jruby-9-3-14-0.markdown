JRuby 9.3.x is compatible with Ruby 2.6.x and stays in sync with C Ruby. As always there is a mix of miscellaneous fixes so be sure to read the issue list below.

Ruby Compatibility
------------------

* IO#fcntl had inverted logic for setting O_NONBLOCK (setting it cleared the value, etc). [#8081], [#8090]

Standard Library
----------------

* strscan is updated to the 3.1.0 version [#8086]

Native Integration
---------------

* The subsystem used for native calls has been updated to support RHEL/CentOS 7 and the Java 9+ Cleaner API. [#8104]
Note: Due to a mistake in the release process 9.3.12.0 released yesterday only changed in version number.  It was essentially 9.3.11.0 with a new version.
