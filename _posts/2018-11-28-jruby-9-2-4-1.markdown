---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 9.2.4.1

- Homepage: [https://www.jruby.org/](https://www.jruby.org/)

JRuby 9.2.x is our new major version of JRuby.  It is expected to be compatible with Ruby 2.5.x and stay in sync with C Ruby.  JRuby 9.2.0.0 is our first release for 2.5 support.

If you do find issues then report them on using our issue tracker at [https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues). We also encourage users to join our IRC channel (#jruby on Freenode) and mailing lists. You may also follow [@jruby](https://twitter.com/jruby) on Twitter for updates.

This is a security release that updates the native Windows executables shipped in the bin directory. A user reported that several virus scanners appear to flag one of these executables, jrubyw.exe, as containing a virus. We scanned the systems used for building those executables, and were unable to find any evidence of infection, but as a precaution we have rebuilt them on a known clean system for this release.
