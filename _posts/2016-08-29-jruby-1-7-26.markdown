JRuby 1.7.26 is our thirtieth update release since JRuby 1.7.0.  The primary goal of 1.7 point releases is to fill out any missing compatibility issues with Ruby 1.9.3.

PSA: Over the years we have had Windows CI support and then lost Windows CI supprt.  We would still irregularly run tests on windows, but this is never as good as getting more immediate feedback.  Via the ability to use an awesome service like ci.appveyor.com, we are again regularly running against a Windows CI.  If you peruse the list of resolved issues you will see how important it is to be regularly running CI on all the OSes you support.

Highlights:

- 8 issues fixed for 1.7.26
