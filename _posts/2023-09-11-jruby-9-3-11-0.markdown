Thank you to our contributors this release, you help keep JRuby moving forward! [@ahorek], [@chadlwilson], [@justinstoller], [@k77ch7], [@kares], [@snoglobe]

Ruby Compatibility
------------------

* Multiple fixes for keyword arguments edge cases. [#7676], [#7755], [#7804], [#7816]

Standard Library
----------------

* strscan is still built-in (not a gem) but has been updated to the 3.0.6 version. [#7634], [#7884], [#7889]
  * Along with this change, our Regexp engine joni is updated to 2.2.1 for Range optimizations.
* Default gem updates:
  * jruby-openssl0.14.2 [#7877]

JVM Integration
---------------

* Virtual thread use in Fiber can now be disabled using the `jruby.fiber.vthread=false` property (or JRuby flag `-Xfiber.vthread=false`). [#7907]

Build and Distribution
----------------------

* The JRuby/Maven stack of plugins used to integrate Ruby and Maven artifacts have been updated to the latest versions, now using JRuby 9.4.3.0 for builds and avoiding the use of deprecated rubygems.org APIs. [#7880]
