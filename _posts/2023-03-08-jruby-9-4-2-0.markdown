JRuby 9.4.x targets Ruby 3.1 compatibility.

Thank you to our contributors this release, you help keep JRuby moving forward! [@k77ch7], [@andsel]

Ruby Compatibility
------------------

* ```__callee__``` now properly returns the name under which a method was called, which will be the new name in the case of aliased methods. [#2305], [#7702]
* More use cases for keyword arguments have been fixed to behave correctly and avoid extraneous warnings. [#7637], [#7645], [#7657], [#7658], [#7670], [#7672], [#7686]
* Array#pack now supports more cases, passing nearly all specs. [#7663]
* Compatibility with CRuby's command-line arguments has been improved. [#7678], [#7680], [#7681], [#7681], [#7683], [#7684]

Standard Library
----------------

* irb is updated to 1.4.2. [#7690], [#7691]
* open-uri is updated to 0.3.0. [#7701]
* io-wait is updated to 0.3.0. [#7701]
* stringio is updated to 3.0.5. [#7701]
* strscan is updated to 3.0.6. [#7701]
* open3 is switched to using the gem at 0.1.2. [#7701]

Platform Support
----------------

* Exception backtraces now default to color output when the controlling terminal is a TTY. Disable using `-Xbacktrace.color=false` or equivalent in .jrubyrc. [#7693]

Performance
-----------

* String#split has been optimized to skip regular expression use for simple split expressions. Simple ASCII strings also split faster. [#7629]
