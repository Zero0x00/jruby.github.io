Ruby Compatibility
------------------

* Support for the new Prism parser for Ruby code has been merged in. A blog post will follow soon. [#8103]
* IO#fcntl had inverted logic for setting O_NONBLOCK (setting it cleared the value, etc). [#8081], [#8090]
* Many fixes to language and core class compatibility, see issue list.
* Warnings should match verbosity levels of CRuby, with many unwanted warnings now properly omitted without verbose enabled. [#7183], [#8071]

Standard Library
----------------

* json is updated to 2.7.1. [#7752], [#7954]
* io-console is updated to 0.7.2. This version fixes IRB on Apple M-series by using stty for console manipulation. [#8012]
* nkf is now supported by gem version 0.2.0. [#8077]
* strscan is updated to 3.1.0. [#8074], [#8086]
* reline is updated to 0.4.2 [#8102]
* jruby-openssl is updated to 0.14.3 [#8107]

JVM Integration
---------------

* Ruby Symbols can be use as arguments to JVM methods that receive Java String. [#8015], [#8057]
* Starting with Java 17, package-private methods will no longer be bound automatically even if they can be made visible. [#8061], [#8093]

Native Integration
---------------

* The subsystem used for native calls has been updated to support RHEL/CentOS 7 and the Java 9+ Cleaner API. [#8104]

Performance
-----------

* Performance of keyword argument handling has been improved. [#8021]
* Pattern matching is now supported in JRuby's JIT compiler. [#8026], [#8027]
