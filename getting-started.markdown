# Getting Started with JRuby
  
JRuby is one of the easiest Ruby implementations to set up. Let's start with the basic instructions:

1. **Download JRuby**:&nbsp;Visit the <a href="/download">download page</a> and grab the binaries for the latest JRuby release.
2. **Unpack JRuby**:&nbsp;Unpack the file you downloaded. You'll then have a &quot;jruby-&lt;version&gt;&quot;&nbsp;directory.
3. **Run JRuby**:&nbsp;The JRuby startup script lives in the &quot;bin&quot;&nbsp;directory. Run &quot;bin/jruby -v&quot; to confirm it.

That's about it!
