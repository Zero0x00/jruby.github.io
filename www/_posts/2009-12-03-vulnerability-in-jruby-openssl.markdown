title: Vulnerability in jruby-openssl < 0.6 - Recommended Upgrade
---
A security problem involving peer certificate verification was found
where failed verification silently did nothing, making affected
applications vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. 

### Impact

Your application would be vulnerable if you're using the 'net/https'
library with OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER mode and any version of
jruby-openssl prior to 0.6.

Example:

{% highlight ruby %}
  require 'net/https'
  uri = URI.parse('https://www.amazon.com/')
  http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
  http.use_ssl = true
  http.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER
  # verisign contains trust anchor for www.amazon.com
  http.ca_file = 'test/fixture/verisign.pem'
  # this code should raise OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError if
  # the trust anchor is correct
  response = http.start do |s|
    s.get(uri.request_uri)
  end
{% endhighlight %}
<br/>

### Release and Patch

- The [0.6 release has the fix][06] for the certificate validation
  vulnerability. Install the upgrade in the usual fashion by running
  `jruby -S gem install jruby-openssl` and ensuring that you get
  version 0.6.
- A [patch is available][06patch] which should apply cleanly to the
  jruby-openssl 0.5.2 source. Ensure the code builds cleanly and
  passes tests by running `jruby -S rake clean default`.
- Please contact [security@jruby.org](mailto:security@jruby.org) if
  you are unable to upgrade or use the 0.5.2 patch and require a
  backport. Let us know what version of jruby-openssl you're using and
  help us understand how you're using the library so we can determine
  whether you're affected by the vulnerability.

### Workarounds

No known workarounds exist, other than rewriting application code to
use a different library to establish validated SSL connections.
