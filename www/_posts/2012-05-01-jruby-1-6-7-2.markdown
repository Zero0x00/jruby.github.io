---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 1.6.7.2.

- Homepage: [http://www.jruby.org/](http://www.jruby.org/)

This is a special release of JRuby which only updates our shipped copy of RubyGems to version 1.8.24.  This version of RubyGems is the first version to verify that a RubyGems server certficate is valid.  This helps to prevent a "man in the middle" style of attack when someone controls a portion of the network between you and the RubyGems server.  All users are encouraged to upgrade to JRuby 1.6.7.2.

### Notable Change:

- Update to Rubygems 1.8.24
