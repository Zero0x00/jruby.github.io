JRuby will be part of Google's Summer of Code 2012!

We're looking for good mentors and students to come together and
help make JRuby even more awesome. JRuby has great potential to
expand Ruby and to improve the state of Ruby development, and at
the same time it represents a number of interesting and unique
challenges.

We have started an ideas page on the JRuby wiki here:

[JRuby GSoC ideas][ideas]

And the GSoC page for JRuby is here:

[JRuby GSoC home][melange]

How to Get Involved
-------------------

If you are a student and interested in working on a JRuby GSoC
project this summer, join the JRuby development [mailing lists][lists]
and let us know what project you have in mind. When the call for
GSoC proposals opens, submit your idea!

If you are a mentor and would like to help a student work on some
project this summer, now is the time to apply at the GSoC page. We
are looking for folks that will be able to educate and encourage
students during the summer, and ideally folks that have solid
experience with the JVM and Java libraries. Experience with JRuby
internals is also strongly recommended.
