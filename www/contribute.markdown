# Contributing to JRuby
  
JRuby depends on community contributions to survive. Here's how you can get involved:

**Get the Source** - The JRuby source is stored in our Git repository at JRuby.org and mirrored at GitHub.

- **JRuby.org**: [**Browse**](http://www.jruby.org/git?p=jruby.git;a=summary) &nbsp;|&nbsp;[**Checkout**](git://jruby.org/jruby.git)
- **GitHub**: [**Browse**](http://github.com/jruby/jruby) &nbsp;|&nbsp;[**Checkout**](git://github.com/jruby/jruby.git)

**Build JRuby** - Once you've checked out the source, you just need to run &quot;ant&quot;&nbsp;or &quot;ant jar&quot;&nbsp;to build and &quot;ant test&quot;&nbsp;to run our test suite. We depend on <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> 1.7.0 or higher.

**Report Bugs** - Our bug tracker uses Atlassian JIRA. You are encouraged to report bugs, no matter how small. Performance problems are considered bugs, so please report those too.

- **Bug Tracker**: [**Browse**]({{ site.urls.jira }})

**Fix Bugs** - We'd love it if you help triage or fix open bugs. We've created a special [**HelpWanted**][helpwanted] section of the bug tracker where we appreciate all the help we can get!

- **HelpWanted**: [Browse][helpwanted]

**Edit the Wiki** - We also depend on community contributions and edits to keep the wiki informative and relevant. If you have a useful FAQ or walkthrough or article, please add it to the wiki. And we welcome anyone who wants to help reorganize or edit existing content.

- **Wiki**: [**Browse**]({{ site.urls.wiki }})
